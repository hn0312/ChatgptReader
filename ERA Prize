1 Introduction  
The Energizing Rural Communities Prize is being offered by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of  Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) to incentivize the development of clean energy projects in rural or  remote areas of the United States. 
The prize offers a $15 million cash prize pool to kickstart development of clean energy projects. This prize  is intended to incentivize competitors to take the first steps necessary to develop a clean energy project.  The competitor should have an idea for a future clean energy project, but no construction is required as  part of this prize. 
This prize seeks to: 
• Demonstrate innovative and replicable partnership and financial mechanisms that act as initial  steps toward clean energy projects. 
• Better prepare rural or remote communities to secure funding for clean energy projects, either  through future Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas (ERA) funding opportunities or  other public or private funding sources.  
• Identify, understand, and further develop activities that prepare communities to complete clean  energy projects. 
• Build trust and strengthen the networks between and within rural and remote communities in  support of energy improvements aligned with DOE’s Justice40 priorities.1 
This prize contains two individual tracks, PARTNER and FINANCE, each with two phases. In Phase One,  competitors should develop a plan to accomplish the goals above. The plan should include proposed  activities, milestones, and metrics measuring the impact and demonstrating the success of proposed  activities by leading to targeted outcomes.  
As summarized in the table below, Phase One winners will receive a cash prize of $100,000, mentorship,  and will be eligible to compete in Phase Two. In Phase Two, winning competitors will be awarded an  additional cash prize of $200,000 based on achievement of milestones and metrics demonstrating  success, as proposed during Phase One. Phase Two competitors are expected to leverage prize funding to  implement their plan developed in Phase One.

A successful submission must demonstrate that the project benefits a rural or remote area. The term  ‘‘rural or remote area’’ is defined by Section 40103(c) of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) as a “city,  town, or unincorporated area that has a population of not more than 10,000 inhabitants.” Applications  must identify at least one area in the United States (including U.S. territories) with a population of not  more than 10,000 (using 2020 Census Bureau figures) that benefits from the proposal. The identified  area must be either: (a) a city, town, or other incorporated municipality, or (b) a Census Designated Place or similarly discreet and identifiable community that is not located within an incorporated municipality. See Appendix B for additional information on this requirement. The terms “rural or remote area,” “rural or  remote community,” and “community” are used interchangeably throughout this document. 
Submissions from individuals, organizations, and communities that historically have not received DOE  funding are encouraged.

2 Background and Program Goals  
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, commonly referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  (BIL), directs DOE to invest $1 billion in energy improvements in rural or remote areas. DOE’s Energy  Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas (ERA) Program will provide financial investment, technical  assistance, and other resources to advance clean energy demonstrations and energy solutions that are  replicable and scalable. The ERA Program aims to fund clean energy projects with three specific goals: 
• Deliver measurable benefits to energy customers in rural or remote areas by funding energy  projects that lower energy cost, improve energy resilience, and/or reduce environmental harm. • Demonstrate new rural or remote energy system models using climate-resilient technologies, new  business structures that promote economic resilience, new financing mechanisms, and/or new  community engagement best practices. 
• Build clean energy knowledge, capacity, and self-reliance in rural America. 
This prize is a cornerstone of the ERA Program and is intended to provide early funding for clean energy  project development preparation. In addition to this prize, DOE intends to issue additional funding  opportunities for constructing clean energy projects under the ERA Program. 
Successful competitors will propose partnership and financial activities that advance clean energy  projects in rural or remote communities for the purpose of: 
A) Improving the overall cost-effectiveness of energy generation, transmission, or distribution  systems 
B) Siting or upgrading transmission and distribution lines  
C) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
D) Providing or modernizing electric generation facilities  
E) Developing microgrids  
F) Increasing energy efficiency. 
This prize is intended as a first step toward a clean energy project, and no construction is required at this  stage. 
2.1 Ensuring Benefits to Rural or Remote Communities  Principles of equity and justice will guide implementation of this program, consistent with the Biden  Administration’s commitments to ensure that overburdened, underserved, and underrepresented  individuals and communities have equitable access to federal resources and receive benefits from  federal investments. ERA Program implementation efforts will follow the Biden Administration’s Justice40  goals, which aim for 40% of the overall benefits from Federal investments in climate, clean energy and  energy efficiency, and job training and workforce development to flow to disadvantaged communities.  ERA investments should not exacerbate existing inequities, such as disproportionate exposure to  environmental hazards and harms, or create new harms, but should instead maximize benefits to  communities. The ERA Program will work to advance equity and justice for all, including people of color  and others who have been historically underserved and adversely affected by persistent poverty and  inequality. 
To ensure that these benefits spread equitably across affected communities, competitors should describe  how the project will support community and workforce engagement, invest in the American workforce, 

Page 7 of 36 

advance energy and environmental justice, and promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility  (DEIA).  
Replicability is key to market adoption of technologies to benefit rural or remote areas beyond those  participating in the ERA Program. Achieving replicability requires that barriers to installing and operating  energy projects in rural or remote communities are mitigated. As such, the program seeks to build  confidence of decision-makers, such as financiers, utilities, and tribal, state, and local governments, who  would enable replication. Competitors in this prize are encouraged to propose partnership and financing  mechanisms that could be replicated in other rural or remote communities. 
2.2 Prize Goals  
This prize contains two individual tracks: PARTNER and FINANCE. The goals of each track are:  
1. PARTNER TRACK GOALS: Facilitate new or existing partnerships that enable development of clean  energy projects in rural or remote communities. Successful competitors will create connections  that lead to collaborative efforts for the development of clean energy projects in rural or remote  communities. Collaborative efforts could include providing engineering services to advance project concepts, encouraging multiple communities to aggregate similar energy projects to  unlock economies of scale, or facilitating equipment acquisition. 
2. FINANCE TRACK GOALS: Connect communities to capital for current or future clean energy  projects by developing innovative and functional business models, new approaches to financing  clean energy projects, the expansion of existing business models to new rural and remote areas,  and innovative ways to leverage other fiscal incentives such as tax credits.  
This plan should propose activities the competitor aims to pursue during Phase Two of the prize and  targeted outcomes these activities aim to deliver. The plan should also demonstrate the previous  experience and resources the competitor will leverage in Phase Two and how proposed activities will  contribute to a rural or remote community’s clean energy goals. Competitors will be evaluated on how well  their plans address the scoring criteria for each track, as described in Sections 3 and 4.  
Proposed activities and targeted outcomes will vary by track, but examples are provided below.  Competitors are not limited to these examples and are encouraged to propose activities and outcomes  that will be most impactful in advancing the community’s energy vision. It is critical that the plan include  milestones and metrics measuring the impact and demonstrating the success of proposed activities.  These metrics will guide the selection process under both tracks and will help shape the evaluation of a  competitor’s implementation of their proposed activities should they be eligible to compete in Phase Two. 
Successful competitors will demonstrate strong ties to rural or remote communities and will show how  they will serve as bridges between DOE and rural or remote communities with whom DOE may not have  previously engaged. 
The Prize Administrator will perform an initial screening of the community a competitor aims to serve. Competitors must identify at least one area in the United States (including U.S. territories) with a  population of not more than 10,000 (using 2020 Census Bureau figures) that benefits from the  submission. The identified area must be either: (a) a city, town, or other incorporated municipality or (b) a  Census Designated Place or similarly discreet and identifiable community that is not located within an  incorporated municipality. Submissions that do not satisfy this requirement will be considered ineligible and removed from further evaluation. See Appendix B for more information on this requirement. 
Competitors may submit multiple applications to both tracks, but the Prize Administrator will only accept  and review one submission per track per community served. The community served will be evaluated for  initial eligibility as a rural or remote community and screened for duplication based on the 9-digit zip code 

Page 8 of 36 

AND name of city, town, incorporated municipality, Census Designated Place, or other unincorporated  area provided by the competitor on the HeroX platform. Additional information on the HeroX platform and  submission process is provided in Sections 3 and 4, detailing the requirements for both tracks.  
If a competitor is unsure of which track they should apply to, they can apply for consideration into both  tracks. Should a competitor submit the same submission under both tracks, that submission can only win  a cash prize in one track. Competitors with separate, distinct submissions to each track may win a cash  prize in both tracks, if DOE determines that the submissions are sufficiently distinct and meritorious.  
2.2.1 PARTNER Track  
The PARTNER Track encourages competitors to form new or leverage existing partnerships to facilitate  clean energy projects in rural or remote areas of the United States. Formal partnership formation should  advance the development of clean energy projects focusing on improving the resilience, safety, reliability,  and availability of energy, and reducing the adverse environmental impacts from energy generation by rural or remote communities. The maturity of the partnerships proposed through this track will be  considered in the evaluation, with preference given to established, formal relationships with organizations  capable of supporting clean energy projects. Maturity of the partnership should be demonstrated with  evidence of a strong commitment to development of a clean energy project. Evidence could include letters of commitment, memoranda of understanding, contracts, and/or funding agreements. 
While we do not expect competitors to construct clean energy projects as part of this prize, competitors  must have a vision for a clean energy project they intend to pursue in a rural or remote community that is  supported by their proposed activity. Partnership activities pursued under this track should advance  completion of this project. Competitors are encouraged to think creatively about what partnership  activities would most directly benefit the clean energy project, but some example activities could include: 
• Building relationships among multiple rural or remote communities that intend to improve  resilience of their electricity systems through upgrading transmission and distribution lines • Building relationships among multiple rural or remote communities to achieve economies of scale  by aggregation of equipment procurement or engineering services 
• Creating a project development team within an organization to facilitate the development of a  clean energy project, such as creating a team that might include developers, community  stakeholders, financiers, and others that are responsible for working with a utility to create a legal  pathway for interconnecting a clean energy project 
• Identifying regional impacts of climate change that reduce the resilience and reliability of local  energy systems, such as droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, or other significant weather events, and  developing plans to improve energy systems to mitigate climate change impacts 
• Developing a contract between a local government and a clean energy training organization to  build a local workforce to support a specific clean energy project. 
Successful submissions will include a description of the targeted outcome the competitor aims to deliver  at the completion of Phase Two. Some example outcomes may include:  
• Project permitting 
• Preliminary engineering studies or designs 
• Renewable energy resource assessments 
• Utility analysis or offtake agreements  
• Hiring and building a team to complete the project 
• Co-signed memorandum of understanding between the partnering organizations that outlines  what they aim to achieve  
• Creation of a new multi-stakeholder organization

Page 9 of 36 

• Other outcomes critical to improving clean energy deployment in rural or remote communities.  Targeted outcomes must connect to the clean energy project the competitor ultimately plans to construct. 
DOE seeks submissions from energy project developers; nonfederal governments; utilities; community based organizations with expertise in clean energy deployment, infrastructure, or resilience; or other  organizations or individuals with creative ideas to help rural or remote communities connect with partners  that enable improving the resilience, safety, reliability, and availability of energy as well as environmental  protection from adverse impacts of energy generation. Competitors are encouraged to form diverse  teams while preparing their Phase One submission.  
2.2.2 FINANCE Track  
The FINANCE Track encourages competitors to improve access to capital for clean energy projects in rural  or remote areas of the United States. Goals of submissions to the FINANCE Track could include: enabling  rural or remote communities to access conventional financing for energy projects, creating pathways for  communities to pursue unconventional capital, connecting finance partners that want to expand  businesses to support clean energy projects for the benefit of rural or remotes areas, or other creative  ideas for improving access to capital for clean energy projects in rural or remote communities. FINANCE  Track competitors are encouraged to demonstrate these ideas but also illustrate the ability to replicate  their model in other rural or remote communities.  
Competitors must identify one or more barriers that rural or remote communities face in financing clean  energy projects. Financing activities pursued under this track should result in targeted outcomes that help  overcome this barrier, either for a specific clean energy project or a type of clean energy project that is  supported by the activity proposed. Competitors are encouraged to think creatively about what financing  activities would most effectively enable access to capital for rural communities. Some examples of these  activities could include: 
• Conduct a market assessment to determine potential demand for and guide design of a clean  energy loan program tailored to rural or remote communities. 
• Determine interest by utility customers or credit union members in a community solar project  through community outreach. 
• Identify sources of additional funding and develop a capital-raising strategy. 
• Issue a Request for Information (RFI) to gather data from project developers. • Train staff who will be evaluating loan applications for clean energy projects. • Conduct community outreach to identify local partners. 
• Identify which Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits and incentives are available for projects in  a specific rural or remote community. 
• Partner with an organization with expertise in rural or remote communities to assist in design of  financial products. 
Successful submissions will include a description of the targeted outcome the competitor aims to deliver  at the completion of Phase Two. Some example outcomes may include:  
• A credit union or a green bank starts to offer loans and other financial support for clean energy  projects in one or more rural and remote communities. 
• A utility launches a new community solar project and begins subscribing customers in a rural or  remote community. 
• A financial institution helps a nonprofit organization qualify clean energy projects for financing. • A project developer demonstrates the feasibility of a unique financing model for a clean energy  project in a rural or remote community.

Page 10 of 36 

• A financial institution develops resources explaining how rural electric cooperatives can  incorporate IRA tax credits and incentives into a variety of clean energy projects in rural or remote  communities. 
• A local or regional government successfully attracts clean energy investment into a rural or  remote community within its jurisdiction. 
• A rural electric cooperative implements a plan to finance sustained operation and maintenance  of an existing or new clean energy system. 
DOE seeks submissions from energy project developers; nonfederal governments; utilities; community  development financial institutions2 and credit unions; green banks and related loan funds that can adapt  their current business models to rural or remote communities; or other organizations with creative ideas  to help rural or remote communities fill funding gaps for clean energy projects. Competitors are  encouraged to form diverse teams while preparing their Phase One submission.  
  
2 Community development financial institutions are financial institutions, such as banks, credit unions, loan funds, or venture capital  funds, that have been certified as Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. CDFI  Certification is the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s recognition of specialized financial institutions serving low-income communities.

In the event of a dispute as to any registration, the authorized account holder of the email address used  to register will be deemed to be the competitor. The "authorized account holder" is the natural person or  legal entity assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider, or other  organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted  address. All competitors may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder. 
A.3 Teams and Single-Entity Awards  
The Prize Administrator will award a single dollar amount to the designated primary submitter, whether  consisting of a single or multiple entities. The primary submitter is solely responsible for allocating any  prize funds among its member competitors or teammates as they deem appropriate. The Prize  Administrator will not arbitrate, intervene, advise on, or resolve any matters or disputes between team  members or competitors.

Upon registration, except in the case of willful  misconduct, all participants agree to and, thereby, do waive and release any and all claims or causes of  action against the Federal Government and its officers, employees, and agents for any and all injury and  damage of any nature whatsoever (whether existing or thereafter arising, whether direct, indirect, or  consequential, and whether foreseeable or not), arising from their participation in the contest, whether  the claim or cause of action arises under contract or tort.  
In accordance with the delegation of authority to run this contest delegated to the judge responsible for  this prize, the judge has determined that no liability insurance naming DOE as an insured will be required 

Page 30 of 36 

of competitors to compete in this competition per 15 U.S.C. § 3719(i)(2). Competitors should assess the  risks associated with their proposed activities and adequately insure themselves against possible losses.  
A.10 Records Retention and Freedom of Information  Act  
All materials submitted to DOE as part of a submission become DOE records and are subject to the  Freedom of Information Act. The following applies only to portions of the submission not designated as  public information in the instructions for submission. If a submission includes trade secrets or  information that is commercial or financial, or information that is confidential or privileged, it is furnished  to the Government in confidence with the understanding that the information shall be used or disclosed  only for evaluation of the application. Such information will be withheld from public disclosure to the  extent permitted by law, including the Freedom of Information Act. Without assuming any liability for  inadvertent disclosure, DOE will seek to limit disclosure of such information to its employees and to  outside reviewers when necessary for review of the application or as otherwise authorized by law. This  restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use the information if it is obtained from another  source.  
Submissions containing confidential, proprietary, or privileged information must be marked as described  below. Failure to comply with these marking requirements may result in the disclosure of the unmarked  information under the Freedom of Information Act or otherwise. The U.S. Government is not liable for the  disclosure or use of unmarked information and may use or disclose such information for any purpose.  
The submission must be marked as follows and identify the specific pages containing trade secrets,  confidential, proprietary, or privileged information: “Notice of Restriction on Disclosure and Use of Data:  Pages [list applicable pages] of this document may contain trade secrets, confidential, proprietary, or  privileged information that is exempt from public disclosure. Such information shall be used or disclosed  only for evaluation purposes. [End of Notice]”  
The header and footer of every page that contains confidential, proprietary, or privileged information must  be marked as follows: “Contains Trade Secrets, Confidential, Proprietary, or Privileged Information Exempt  from Public Disclosure.” In addition, each line or paragraph containing proprietary, privileged, or trade  secret information must be clearly marked with double brackets.  
Competitors will be notified of any Freedom of Information Act requests for their submissions in  accordance with 29 C.F.R. § 70.26. Competitors may then have the opportunity to review materials and  work with a Freedom of Information Act representative prior to the release of materials. DOE does intend  to keep all submission materials private except for those materials designated as “will be made public.” 
A.11 Privacy  
If you choose to provide HeroX with personal information by registering or completing the submission  package through the contest website, you understand that such information will be transmitted to DOE  and may be kept in a system of records. Such information will be used only to respond to you in matters  regarding your submission and/or the contest unless you choose to receive updates or notifications about  other contests or programs from DOE on an opt-in basis. DOE and NREL are not collecting any information  for commercial marketing.  
A.12 General Conditions  
DOE reserves the right to cancel, suspend, and/or modify the prize, or any part of it, at any time. If any  fraud, technical failures, or any other factor beyond DOE's reasonable control impairs the integrity or 

Page 31 of 36 

proper functioning of the prize, as determined by DOE in its sole discretion, DOE may cancel the prize. Any  performance toward prize goals is conducted entirely at the risk of the competitor and DOE shall not  compensate any competitors for any activities performed in furtherance of this prize.  
Although DOE may indicate that it will select up to several winners for each prize, DOE reserves the right  to only select competitors that are likely to achieve the goals of the program. If, in DOE’s determination,  no competitors are likely to achieve the goals of the program, DOE will select no competitors to be  winners and will award no prize money.  
A.13 Program Policy Factors  
While the scores of the expert reviewers will be carefully considered, it is the role of the prize judge to  maximize the impact of prize funds. Some factors outside the control of competitors and beyond the  independent expert reviewer scope of review may need to be considered to accomplish this goal. The  
following is a list of such factors. In addition to the reviewers’ scores, the below program policy factors  may be considered in determining winners:  
● Geographic diversity and potential economic impact of projects.  
● Whether the use of additional DOE funds and provided resources are non-duplicative and  compatible with the stated goals of this program and the DOE mission generally.  ● The degree to which the submission exhibits technological or programmatic diversity when compared to the existing DOE project portfolio and other competitors.  
● The degree to which the submission is likely to lead to increased employment and manufacturing  in the United States or provide other economic benefits to U.S. taxpayers.  
● The degree to which the submission will accelerate transformational technological, financial, or  workforce advances in areas that industry by itself is not likely to undertake because of technical  or financial uncertainty.  
● The degree to which the submission supports complementary DOE-funded efforts or projects,  which, when taken together, will best achieve the goals and objectives of DOE.  
● The degree to which the submission expands DOE’s funding to new competitors and recipients  who have not been supported by DOE in the past.  
● The degree to which the submission enables new and expanding market segments.  A.14 National Environmental Policy Act Compliance  This prize is subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. § 4321, et seq.). NEPA  requires federal agencies to integrate environmental values into their decision-making processes by  considering the potential environmental impacts of their proposed actions. For additional background on  NEPA, please see DOE’s NEPA website at http://nepa.energy.gov/.  
While NEPA compliance is a federal agency responsibility and the ultimate decisions remain with the  federal agency, all participants in the Energizing Rural Communities Prize will be required to assist in the  timely and effective completion of the NEPA process in the manner most pertinent to their participation in  the prize competition. Participants may be asked to provide DOE with additional information on the  proposed activities such that DOE can conduct a meaningful evaluation of the potential environmental  impacts.  
A.15 Return of Funds  
As a condition of receiving a prize, competitors agree that if the prize was made based on fraudulent or  inaccurate information provided by the competitor to DOE, DOE has the right to demand that any prize  funds or the value of other non-cash prizes be returned to the government.

ALL DECISIONS BY DOE ARE FINAL AND BINDING IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE PRIZE.  A.16 Eligibility and Competitors  
The competition is open only to private entities (for-profits and nonprofits), non-federal government  entities such as states, counties, tribes, and municipalities, academic institutions, and individuals,  subject to the following requirements:  
● Private entities must be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United  States with majority domestic ownership and control.  
● Academic institutions must be based in the United States.  
● An individual prize competitor or group of competitors who are not competing as part of an  incorporated private entity must all be United States citizens or legal permanent residents.  ● Individuals competing as part of an incorporated private entity may participate if they are legally  allowed to work in the United States.  
● DOE employees, employees of sponsoring organizations, members of their immediate families  (e.g., spouses, children, siblings, or parents), and persons living in the same household as such  persons, whether or not related, are not eligible to participate in the prize.  
● Individuals who worked at DOE (federal employees or support service contractors) within six  months prior to the submission deadline of any contest are not eligible to participate in any prize  contests in this program. 
● Federal entities and federal employees are not eligible to participate in any portion of the prize.  ● DOE National Laboratory employees cannot compete in the prize.  
● Entities and individuals publicly banned from doing business with the U.S. government, such as  entities and individuals debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for  participating in federal programs, are not eligible to compete.  
● Entities and individuals identified as a restricted party on one or more screening lists of  Department of Commerce, State, and the Treasury are not eligible to compete. See Consolidated  Screening List. 
● This prize competition is expected to positively impact U.S. economic competitiveness.  Participation in a foreign government talent recruitment program7 could conflict with this  objective by resulting in unauthorized transfer of scientific and technical information to foreign  government entities. Therefore, individuals participating in foreign government talent recruitment  programs of foreign countries of risk are not eligible to compete. Further, teams that include  individuals participating in foreign government talent recruitment programs of foreign countries of  risk8 are not eligible to compete.  
● As part of your submission to this prize program, you will be required to sign the following  statement:  
I am providing this submission package as part of my participation in this prize. I understand  that I am providing this submission to the Federal Government. I certify under penalty of  perjury that the named competitor meets the eligibility requirements for this prize  
7 Foreign government talent recruitment program is defined as an effort directly or indirectly organized, managed, or funded by a foreign  government to recruit science and technology professionals or students (regardless of citizenship or national origin, and whether having a  full-time or part-time position). Some foreign government-sponsored talent recruitment programs operate with the intent to import or  otherwise acquire from abroad, sometimes through illicit means, proprietary technology or software, unpublished data and methods, and  intellectual property to further the military modernization goals and/or economic goals of a foreign government. Many, but not all,  programs aim to incentivize the targeted individual to physically relocate to the foreign state for the above purpose. Some programs allow  for or encourage continued employment at U.S. research facilities or receipt of federal research funds while concurrently working at and/or  receiving compensation from a foreign institution, and some direct participants not to disclose their participation to U.S. entities.  Compensation could take many forms including cash, research funding, complimentary foreign travel, honorific titles, career advancement  opportunities, promised future compensation, or other types of remuneration or consideration, including in-kind compensation. 8 Currently, the list of countries of risk includes Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China.

competition and complies with all other rules contained in the Official Rules document. I  further represent that the information contained in the submission is true and contains no  misrepresentations. I understand false statements or misrepresentations to the Federal  Government may result in civil and/or criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. § 1001 and § 287.

Appendix B: Determining the Population of a  Rural or Remote Community  
B.1 Definitions  
Rural or Remote Area: The term ‘‘rural or remote area’’ is defined by Section 40103(c) of the BIL as a  “city, town, or unincorporated area that has a population of not more than 10,000 inhabitants.”  Applications must identify at least one area in the United States (including U.S. territories) with a  population of not more than 10,000 (using 2020 Census Bureau figures) that benefits from the proposal.  The identified area must be either: (a) a city, town, or other incorporated municipality, or (b) a Census  Designated Place or similarly discreet and identifiable community that is not located within an  incorporated municipality. Applications that do not satisfy this requirement will be considered ineligible  and removed from further evaluation. 
Census Designated Place: The U.S. Census Bureau defines a Census Designated Place (CDP) as a  statistical geography representing closely settled, unincorporated communities that are locally recognized  and identified by name. CDPs are statistical equivalents of incorporated places and represent  unincorporated communities that do not have a legally defined boundary or an active, functioning  governmental structure. Examples of CDPs include unincorporated communities, planned communities,  military installments, university towns, and resort towns. A single location cannot be part of both an  incorporated place and a CDP. 
Incorporated Municipality: An incorporated municipality is legally incorporated under state law, has a  legally defined boundary, and has an active functioning governmental structure. Examples of incorporated  municipalities include cities, towns, and villages. A single location cannot be part of both an incorporated  place and a CDP9. 
Unincorporated Area: For the purposes of this prize, “unincorporated area” refers to a Census Designated  Place or similarly discreet and identifiable community that is not located within an incorporated  municipality. 
B.2 Using U.S. Census Bureau Data to Determine  Community Population  
The U.S. Census Bureau records the population of incorporated and unincorporated communities. This  information can be found on different locations within the U.S. Census Bureau website, depending on the  location of the community. The tips below may help you verify the population of the rural or remote  community that will benefit from the proposed clean energy project based on the name of that  community: 
• For incorporated communities located in the Continental United States, Hawai’i, Puerto Rico, or  Alaska, look up the population using the name of the community directly: 
o Go to https://data.census.gov/. 
o In the search bar, enter the name of the city, town, or similar incorporated municipality and hit “Enter” to look up the total population. 
9 This definition is adapted from the U.S. Census Bureau definition for Incorporated Place.

Page 35 of 36 

• For unincorporated communities located in the Continental United States, Hawai’i, Puerto Rico, or  Alaska (check to see if your community is listed as a CDP using commonly known names): o Go to https://data.census.gov/. 
o In the search bar, enter the commonly known names of the unincorporated community o If a drop-down list appears, look for the name of the unincorporated community followed  by “CDP” and the state. Click on this search result to look up the total population. • For incorporated and unincorporated communities located on an island territory, please use the  following island-specific pages to locate the appropriate data for incorporated or unincorporated  places: 
o American Samoa 
o Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) 
o Guam 
o U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Note that the above methods require entry of the name of the incorporated or unincorporated place. If  you do not have this information, it may be possible to search for it on https://data.census.gov by searching for a five-digit zip code or county name. This may pull up the name of a CDP directly, or it may  link to a map on which you can look for relevant incorporated or unincorporated places. 
Please note that while the 5-Digit Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA5) and county may be useful for  identifying the name of a relevant city, town, or unincorporated area, it will not be used to verify the  10,000 inhabitants requirement. DOE will perform this verification based on the name of the city, town, or  unincorporated area provided in the HeroX platform, as described in Section 2.2.
